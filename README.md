# labs

All labs are preloaded onto the NUCs in front of the room. You will find cards located on desks that indicate the IP address, username and password to perform remote development with VSCode. These machines have all required dependencies to perform the labs. 

> In case you wish to not leverage the machines provided today. You may download the labs from the following repo: https://github.com/rsdmike/labs . You must also use the customized docker-compose here: https://github.com/rsdmike/developer-scripts.git



## Prerequisites
